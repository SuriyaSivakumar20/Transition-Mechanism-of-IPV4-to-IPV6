# 🌐 IPv6 Transition Mechanism 🚀

A comprehensive project to implement and analyze IPv6 transition mechanisms, ensuring seamless communication between IPv4 and IPv6 networks. 🔄

---

## 🌟 Features
- 🌐 **Dual Stack Implementation**: Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 communication.
- 🔄 **Tunneling Mechanism**: Encapsulates IPv6 packets within IPv4 headers.
- 🛠️ **NAT64/DNS64 Support**: Enables IPv6-only devices to communicate with IPv4 servers.
- 📊 **Performance Analysis**: Evaluates latency, throughput, and packet loss.
