# 🌐 IPv6 Transition Mechanism 🚀

A comprehensive project to implement and analyze IPv6 transition mechanisms, ensuring seamless communication between IPv4 and IPv6 networks. 🔄

🛠️ Tools Used in This Project
This project utilizes the following tools and technologies to implement IPv6 transition mechanisms:

🖥️ Wireshark: For network traffic analysis and debugging.
🌐 Cisco Packet Tracer: To simulate IPv6 and IPv4 networks and their interactions.
🔐 OpenSSL: For implementing encryption mechanisms (AES, RSA).
🌐 Netcat: For testing basic networking functionality.
🛠️ Python: Used for scripting and implementing the transition mechanisms and logic.
🧪 Scapy: For custom packet crafting and analysis.

🌟 Features
🌐 Dual Stack Implementation: Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 communication.
🔄 Tunneling Mechanism: Encapsulates IPv6 packets inside IPv4 headers.
🛠️ NAT64/DNS64: Allows IPv6-only devices to communicate with IPv4-only servers.
📊 Performance Analysis: Evaluates performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and packet loss.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language:
Networking Protocols: IPv4, IPv6, NAT64, DNS64, Tunneling (6to4)
Tools: Wireshark, Netcat, Cisco Packet Tracer, OpenSSL

🎉 How It Works
Dual Stack: Enables devices to operate in both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously.
Tunneling: IPv6 packets are encapsulated within IPv4 headers for transmission.
NAT64/DNS64: Translates IPv6 requests to IPv4 for backward compatibility.
Performance Analysis: Measures and analyzes latency, throughput, and packet loss in mixed IPv4/IPv6 environments.
