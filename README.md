# 🌐 Computer Networks Project: Secure File Transfer Protocol 🔒

Implementing a secure and efficient file transfer protocol with robust encryption and error detection. 🚀✨

---

## 🌟 Features
- 🔐 **Secure Communication**: Utilizes encryption (AES/RSA) for secure data transmission.
- 🛠️ **Error Detection**: Implements CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) for integrity.
- 📡 **Network Layers Simulation**: Simulates OSI model layers for data transmission.
- 💬 **Real-Time Communication**: Chat server functionality included.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white)
- **Network Protocols**: TCP/IP, UDP, ARP
- **Encryption**: AES, RSA
- **Error Detection**: CRC Algorithms

---

## 🎉 How It Works
1. **Sender**: Encrypts the file and sends it over a simulated network.
2. **Receiver**: Receives the file, verifies integrity, and decrypts it.
3. **Error Detection**: Ensures no data corruption during transmission.
